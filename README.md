# oldastoria.org

Inspired by both [```oldnyc.org```](https://www.oldnyc.org) and [```oldsf.org```](http://www.oldsf.org), this project
 utilizes the Google Maps API to map historical photos of Astoria, OR. 
 
To run, begin by installing package dependencies via npm:
 ``` npm install ```
Then to view in the browser start the express_router:
 ``` node src/express_router.js ```
